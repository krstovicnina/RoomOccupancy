# RoomOccupancy
Prediction of room occupancy with PySpark


This project was made as an assignment for Mining of Massive Datasets course. 
The assignment was as follows: 

Instructions
1. Select a binary classification dataset from one of the following machine learning dataset sources:

https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

https://www.kaggle.com/

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

https://datahub.io/

Note: the dataset should have at least 4 independent variables, and at least one of them should be a categorical variable. The project should be done by utilizing pyspark.

2. Data processing and exploratory data analysis 

3. Build and evaluate the model - use Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifier  

4. Hyperparameter optimization and evaluation of the best model 

4. Conclusion and findings
